  <h1><code>Nyefari's Portfolio Website</code></h1>

  <strong>A personal website built using <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack">wasm-pack</a>.</strong>

  This website is a project to practice using rust and javascript, primarily. I also wanted experience actually publishing a non-wordpress site to the web and I wanted a place to put random ramblings and developer updates. Expect radical changes over time. 

  The website is no longer live, and has been superceded by a WP site now at nyefari.com
